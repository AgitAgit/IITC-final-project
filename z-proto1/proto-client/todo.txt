NOTES
For future versions where Porat and Eden will contribute, strong typing will be important
so they know how to use the frame I am building.


basic editor1

basic editor2
//goal1: 
DONE// generate a menu with 3 buttons, each one generate a different component;DONE

//goal2: 
DONE// generate a page layout object that records all the objects and their positions and data; DONE
POSTPONED// save 2 pre-made pages and toggle between them;POSTPONED

only those goals. Improvements to typing and order should happen in further versions.
Don't abstract too early.

I need to edit editableText and ButtonRandom so the receive props with content.

basic editor3
pass the renderElements data through useContext? I still need to pass the id to the component...
